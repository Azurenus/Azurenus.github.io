Well, it finally happened. COVID-19 isolation has finally driven me to the point
where I'm blogging about the things that I'm working on. I'll be honest, I have 
no clue what I'm doing with this blog but I'm sure I'll figure it out. Currently, 
I'm thinking I can post things about the cloud, programming, and even some video 
game content. I'm sure time will tell, because boy howdy, don't we all have nothing 
but time these days.
